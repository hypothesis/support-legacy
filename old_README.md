## support team structure
- There will be two team members on support each week: the Support Engineer[1] and a developer, acting as "1st-line" and "2nd-line" support, respectively. When the Support Engineer is out, the Product Manager or another team member will step in as 1st-line support (this will be indicated in the Team Calendar). Notifications indicating which developer is on 2nd-line support appear in the #support channel in Slack.
- **For the 1st-line support person**, requests come in (mostly) through Zendesk and are escalated to the on-call developer if necessary.
- **For the on-call developer**, we use PagerDuty to alert of engineering monitoring issues which need immediate attention. You may also be asked to work with 1st-line support on issues they are unable to resolve. 
- Issues that block critical activity by Hypothesis users on weekends may need attention from both first and second line support, though this is a rare occurrence.

[1] When the Support Engineer is out of the of the office, the Product Manager will act as 1st-line support. If both the Support Engineer and Product Manager are out of the office, the Engineering Manager will serve as the first point of contact, with the rest of the Product team providing backup.
